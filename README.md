## 📖 Executive Summary

**ForenSight AI** is a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to solve the critical flaws in modern CCTV surveillance: **Passive Recording**, **High Latency**, and **Prohibitive Cloud Costs**.

Built as a Final Year Project for the **Department of Information and Communication Engineering**, this system introduces a **Hybrid Edge-Cloud Architecture**. It processes video streams locally on commodity hardware (laptops) using advanced AI models, ensuring data ownership and millisecond-level responsiveness, while utilizing a serverless cloud relay for worldwide secure access.

### 🛑 The Problem
*   **Traditional NVRs** are "dumb" recording boxes that only provide evidence *after* a crime.
*   **Cloud Cameras (Ring/Nest)** destroy bandwidth and have localized privacy risks.
*   **Enterprise AI (Verkada)** costs thousands of dollars per camera annually.

### ✅ The ForenSight Solution
*   **Smart:** 59+ Verified Detection Features (Weapons, Fire, Faces, Behavior).
*   **Fast:** <100ms Inference Time via local Edge processing.
*   **Free:** Utilizes CloudFlare Tunnels and Local Storage for **$0/month** operation.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

ForenSight utilizes a **Decentralized 4-Tier Architecture**:

1.  **Tier 1: Edge Node (Python/PyQt6)** - Runs on-site. Grabs RTSP feeds, runs YOLOv8/ArcFace inference, and stores encrypted logs locally.
2.  **Tier 2: Secure Tunnel (CloudFlare)** - Exposes the local API to the web via a secure, zero-trust outbound connection.
3.  **Tier 3: Central Relay (FastAPI/PostgreSQL)** - Handles User Authentication (OAuth2) and signals routing.
4.  **Tier 4: Client Portal (React 19)** - A modern SPA for viewing live feeds and alerts from anywhere in the world.
